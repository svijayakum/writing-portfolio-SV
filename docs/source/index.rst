Education
----------

Certification | February 2018 | Johns Hopkins University

* Major: Data Science
* Related coursework: R Programming; Exploratory Data Analysis; Statistical Inference; Regression Models; Practical Machine Learning; Text Prediction-Capstone	
* `Text Prediction Project`_: Developed an n-gram model, which will allow the prediction of a word given the previous one, two or three words. Exploratory analysis was done to understand the distribution and relationship between the words, tokens and phrases in three different text files. Bi, Tri and Quad-gram models were built to determine the frequency of word groups. The text prediction algorithm takes in a word or phrase as input and pre-processes this input and extracts out the relevant N-gram frequencies. The words containing the highest frequencies are returned as predictions.
